      <p>
        Warsow was first publicly released on June 8, 2005 as an alpha version. The stable version 1.0 was released on July 28, 2012 after 7 years of development. Warsow's codebase is free and open source software, distributed under the terms of the GPL; it is built upon Qfusion, an advanced modification of the Quake II engine. The artwork and other media were originally licensed under the proprietary Warsow Content License, which allowed the contributors of this media to use the work in a "personal portfolio" but not in any other game, but have around 2012 released under the Creative Commons License Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.
